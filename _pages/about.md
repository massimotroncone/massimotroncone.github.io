I am Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wilf Family Department of Politics at [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html). My research is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

My work lies at the intersection of distributive politics and electoral institutions. I study how public resources are allocated, with a focus on legislative politics, clientelism, and re-election incentives. I typically combine observational data with methods for causal inference.

On this page, you can find information about my research. Feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:mt6068@nyu.edu).
